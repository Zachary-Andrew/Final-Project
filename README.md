## Project Description
In this project, we aim to answer the question: What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh? We will use data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) to create a data-driven argument to support our claim about the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh. To do this, we have defined and measured "bestness" through three submetrics: fire incidents, speed limits, and arrests.

This project is to answer what the best negiborhood in Pittsburgh is. We will be using datasets from WPRDC to create a data-driven arugment that will support our team's claim on what is the "best" neightborhood in Pittsubrgh. We came up with three submettics to analyze: fire incidents, speed limits, and arrests. 

## Submetrics
Fire Incidents: Zachary will analyze fire incident data to assess neighborhood safety and emergency response effectiveness.
Speed Limit: Rodrigo will investigate speed limit data to evaluate neighborhood traffic safety.
Arrests: Saung will examine arrest data to assess neighborhood crime rates and law enforcement activity.
