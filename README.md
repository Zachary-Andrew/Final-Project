## Project Description
This project aims to investigate and identify the safest neighborhood in Pittsburgh. We used the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) to obtain reliable, detailed information supporting our findings. A composite metric, integrating fire incidents, speeding incidents, and arrests, offers a comprehensive view of neighborhood safety. a metric that included three crucial components: fire incidents, speeding incidents, and arrests. We selected these three factors based on their potential to provide a comprehensive view of safety in the area. The project concludes with a combined metric graph, visually representing safety scores for each neighborhood and identifying the safest and most dangerous areas.
